Tor Browser
- access to TOR network - daknet/clearnet
- different levels of security
- browser finger print - OS, size of window/laptop version, localization etc etc
- bits of information ~ 32 bits to detect person
   - highest around 6.8
   - middle around 14?
   - default 13?
- some ISP can block TOR connection - TOR bridges ~ servers to connect into TOR
- list on tor website or can receive via email from torproject email
- OBFS4 - pluggable transport?


Tails
- live OS - wipe out all ram on unplug/ turn off
- all traffic through TOR, except Unsafe Browser - only direct connection
- can have persistent storage with passphrase
- TOR browser has access only to one directory named Tor Browser (or 2 if has persistent equivalent)
- to use VPN - either provider who support tails
             - or need to configure a firewall and run openVPN client with provider config 

- TOR network search - notEvil
                     - Torch
                     - ahmia
- social media?                     
      reddit like forum - Dread
      quora like - Hidden Answers
       
- list of onion links         
      hidden wiki - !!!! might have malicious links
      dark.fail - pgp signed links should be more reliable
      
- fake identity - Forsaken

emails
- temporary email provider - deleting data after expiration date
                           - quick and simple for quick verification
                           - tempmailaddress.com, guerrillamail.com
                           
- private mail providers - proton - open source, end2end
                                  - questionable with metadata
                                  - available on both clearnet & darknet (can send between both) 
                                  - needs javascript (if you believe open source, it might be OK)
                                  - law compliant
                                      
- darknet email providers - some work only on darknet
                          - no js, no tracking
                          - Elude - allows send to clearnet   
                            TorBox - only darknet                                 
      
messengers
- xmpp - decentralized
       - can join a server to get account
       - can even run own server
       - can run on onion service
       - can be used with pidgin
       - jabber/pidgin
       - pidgin - advanced/server/insert onion service address
                - traffic will not leave TOR network for the clearnet        
                - OTR (off the record)
                   - plugin allowing e2e encryption
                   - tools/plugins/otr - configure - tick "automatic initiate private messaging"
                                                   - tick "require private messaging" 
                   - when set - start private conversation (might need to verify the contact - question/secret/digital fingerprint via another channel)
      
file sharing
- remove meta data 
   - on tails - right click/remove metadata -> creates cleaned copy

- send.vis.ee - upload encrypted file,
              - can set when delete the file (number of downloads/time period) 
              - create link with decrypting key for the file       
              - user (anyone) who has the link with decrypt key can download and decrypt
              - uses javascript

- onion share - p2p, e2ee, through TOR, files stored locally
              - creates local onion service to be accessible from TOR to get the file               
              - on tails - right click/share via onionshare
                         - can add more files
                         - start share - creates onion link
                         - stop share - close connection
                         - when file transfered - sharing stops
                         
- remove file - removing (i.e. Move To Trash) just mark area on disk as available
              - data still available to read until rewritten
              - right click/Wipe - override data on the area which was occupied by the file
                                 - can set number of rounds of overriding
                                 - works on HDD, but not on SSD/USB stick                        
              - mass delete - Move To Trash, then right click/Wipe available disk space - override 'available area'
                            - works on HDD, but not on SSD/USB stick
                            
erase disk - on Tails - Applications/Utilities/Disk    
                          - select device - format volume - enable erase to clean the disk
encrypt disk - on Tails - Applications/Utilities/Disk    
                          - select device - format volume - for linux (ex4)
                                                                - tick password protected volume LUKS - use passphrase

encryption                                                                
-verify downloaded file
  - hash - GtkHash - select file and check hash  
- pgp - prety good encryption
- symetric encryption - same key for sender and receiver
                          - needs to be shared  
- asymetric encryption - private key
                       - public key
                       - alice uses bobs' public key to encrypt message, send, then bob decrypts the message with his private key 

- generate key pairs - in Tails - application Kleopatra
                                   - has pre-generated keys for packages verification - do not delete
                                   - File/New Key Pair - open PGP  
                                          Export - to export public key 
- encrypting text - kleopatra - Notepad - write message
                              - Recipient - Sign As - select my key
                                          - Encrypt for me - select my key
                                          - Encrypt for others - select public key
                              - click encrypt - Notepad tap filled with encrypted message
                                      decrypt - fill passphrase for private key - if correct shows decrypted message

- encryption ensures secret message but not authentication -> signatures
- encrypted message with public key of receiver is signed by private key of sender - encrypted and authenticated 
     - signature can be verified against public key of the sender 
     - in Kleopatra with Show Audit Log - show result of checked signature
     
- encrypting files - Kleopatra - Sign/Encrypt button - select file (maybe first remove metadata)  
                               - same flow as with text - Sign As
                                                          Encrypt for me                                            
                                                          Encrypt for others
- derypting files - Kleopatra  - Decrypt/Verify - select file (maybe first remove metadata)  
                               - same flow as with text
                               
- signing without encryption - just uncheck encryption
- verifying without encryption -file and signature should have the same name (file.txt, file.txt.sig) - check Show Audit Log

- verifying file on Linux  see https://support.torproject.org/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/
   - fetch and import developers key 
        gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser@torproject.org                               
-  - save key to the file
        gpg --output ./tor.keyring --export 0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290 //<-- key printed from previous command
   (- refresh key if necessary
        gpg --refresh-keys EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290 )     
   - download binary file and related signature file (.asc) and execute command to verify the file
        gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ~/Downloads/tor-browser-linux-x86_64-13.0.1.tar.xz.asc ~/Downloads/tor-browser-linux-x86_64-13.0.1.tar.xz

- select app to run on VM - starting VM then running the app
                          - VMs not running by default on startup
                          
- when finished in some domain - to free the memory from VM - manual shut down (main bar icon) 

Files  
- sharing files (copying) between VMs - right click/Copy To Other AppVM            
                                     - in domain where to we copy - go to /home/UubesIncoming/[domain name]
- open suspicious file - right click/Open in dispossable machine - will start a new VM
                                     Edit in dispossable machine - open for editting - can save to original domain from which it was asked to open in disposable VM

- insert from global clipboard from - ctrl + shift + v and the ctrl + v                           


Applications
- everything installed outside of the home  directory will get wiped out on shutdown/restart   
- installing on template will install to every derived VM (visible after restart if running)
    - attention!: everything outside of Home folder is wiped out                       
- adding installed app into context menu - qubes manager-select VM - settings - application tab
