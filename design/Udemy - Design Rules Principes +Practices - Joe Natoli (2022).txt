- reason why, when what
- usage with thumbs on mobile - bottom menus
                               - 48px as min clickable square
- not just decoration
- balance = content space, group similar content together
          - space between content creates channels of the flow
- rythm - repeating in the same way - e.g. list view - same elements, same order of elements
- harmony - reusing constructs = same padding, font color ~ echos 
          - anomaly to increase focus (e.g. button in form)
- directional flow - improved with harmony
                   - controlled by dominance - set dominant element to get focus
                                             - mainly by size and contrast
                   - set flow with harmony
- alignment improves fast readability = decrease different starts/ends of elements    
- proximity - distance between visual elements ~ define relationship -> closer elements - closer relationship 
            - distance is stronger than color/contrast  
- colors - subjective, based on region
         - choose based on associations, emotions, brand
         - should highlight & guide not be used as sole differentiator (color blind people) -  
                  - visual accents - bright & saturated - links/hashtag/like
                  - dialogs - light + muted colors  
         - app usage should not depend on colors - e.g. color + icon to highlight error (not only color)    
         - "color theory" - quick sheet - as cheat sheet, complex topic
                                        - black,white,red - most contrast usages 
                          - black - cool, power/authority
                          - white - clean pure, peace
                          - red - alarm, urgency, danger, love
                             
                          - pink - admiration, romance, harmony
                          - blue - innovation, tech, business
                                 - light friend
                                 - dark security
                          - green - nature, calm, relax, success, money, growth
                          - yellow - joy, happiness, positivity
                          - purple - luxury, wealth
                          - home, friendship, solidity, richness, nature 
         - theme colors - e.g. from logo, keep low saturation - eye strain - keep low around 50%
                        - shadow -darkest
                        - midtone 
                        - highlight
                        - accent - i.e. links                                
- contrast - beats colors
           - improves
              - readability - text color-background color
              - attention - link, bold text
              - focus - highlight dominant elements (buttons/links)
           
- typography - can rise emotion
             - bold, uppercase - scream, intense, less space between (condensated text)                        
             - pattern recognition - creative fonts harder to read for brain   
             - kerning - spacing between letters - font property - same space -> better
             - leading space between lines of text - line height
             - 7 rules - 1) max 2 font families - should have similar properties ~ harmony - kerning, weight, letter widths
                                                - should be visually different - to distinguish 
                         2) line width - easier for brain : 60 characters (web)
                                                            30-40 characters (mobile)      
                         3) readability - diff sizes with resolutions
                         4) legibility ~ distinguishable letter, e.g. I - L : Illuvium
                                       - low kerning creates artificial letter from two letters rn -> m  
                         5) space between paragraphs - brain rest - increase understanding/process cca 20% 
                                                     - leading - half of character height     
                         6) align text elements with baselines  - faster scanning
                         7) styles to differentiate content  - regular , italic, bold 
- imagery - should serve purpose - pass message, improve understanding, or  rise emotion 
          - propagation with people, not just 'the thing', people not looking into camera ~ user is becoming them
          - crop can change perspective - message    
          - dont do cheap shot, objectify people - sexiest/demanding
          - illustration can say more than photo - can provide emotional support    
          
- icons - use labels if no clear meaning - if context is clear then no need of label
        - category - similar - info, helps understand (restriction, info)
                   - symbolic - abstraction, action  (menu, print, delete)  
                   - example - exemplify (click, swipe, cut)
                   - arbitrary - need to be learned the meaning
        - should leverage already existing and known icons from OS  
        - recognizable and memorable
        - keep: perceived size (feel size -width and height) of all icons  
                detail level - more complex are more dominant - keep simple
                 match styles - dont mix wire with fill style 
                              - can mix for hover/highlighted items  
- data - depends on context what should be used, should be understandable (less is readable)
       - 3 types of visualization
            - persuasive - change opinion, propaganda
            - informative - neutral, educate, pass info
            - visual art  - enjoyment as outcome 
- simpler is better            
- separate content from controls (clear difference from clickable and non-clickable content)
- highlight primary actions might be good (e.g.: publish-save-cancel)
