Don't Make Me Think
- book review: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited 

- make website simple, self-explanatory
- make clear what is clickable, what is expects input etc
- do not overload with information
- 2-3 click limit (to reach anything) is good guide, not a religion

- users do not read - user scans
   - avoid noise (to many click me or too much data/info to show)
   - use known conventions
   - hierarchy 
      - main section navigation - top page, always available  
      - website logo + name - to make clear what page
                            - tagline - should not be motto, but what you get, why you should come [and stay]
      - breadcrumbs - easy to get back - e-shop subcategories: Main > sub> sub-sub 
      - page title - for redirect from search/newsletter to make obvious where user is (subsection or section) 
      - utility section - top right -search, faq, login, cart
      - sub-navigation - make clear which subsection user is in (can combine with breadcrumbs)
                       - usage of tabs (in 2025?) 
      - main page should explain what it is/does
         - avoid happy talk, use brief intro
      
   - text formatting h1, h2,... to separate sections on the page
      - bottom margin better lower than top to not make titles 'float' - but stick to text it belongs to
      
- user does not go for the best option found, but for the FIRST GOOD ENOUGH
   - if does not fit - goes back and search for another good enough

   
- user muddle through - tries to find own way how to use - UX should be stupid proof
   - user reads instructions only when really have to        
   
- omit needless words - shorter paragraphs - supports scanning - comfortable to scan search
                      - avoid happy talks   
                      - instructions only when really needed
                          - input can get preformatted/limitted to avoid extra instructions
   
- godfellas test - imagine being in trunk blindfolded then see website - you should orient yourself fast and understand what it offers/does

- clash designer x developer x other useless roles (pm/marketing/hr)
    - goal to deliver the best usability, open mind 
      - usability testing - observe user using the website/app
                          - note surprising behavior 
                          - highlight he biggest issues - work on them first
                          - if time fix smaller fast issues
                          - test more people- 3 if not budget
                                            - or only yourself
                          - test continuosly
                             - simple approach once per month 
                             - testing at the end - expensive and too late  
                          - dont guide - let them muddle through (if not in rage mode)
                          - ask feedback at the end
                             - do not rely much on their improvement suggestions
                             - feeling could differ between people
                             - cannot satisfy all
                             
- mobile - desining mobile first does not work much
         - performance is important - loading big pictures (hello async?)
         - should be learnable and memorable - clear how to use next time if special features
         
- user patience - can vary - might be crazy from previous website, wife argument
- average user does not exist - do not optimize for average user
- reflect disabled people (color blind, alt for pictures, etc)
- stay away from dirty techniques - hiding pricing till the last step, predefined checkbox for personal data share etc
