Java Security Evolution - Out with the Old, In with the New (2025)
- video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLJQC7LKCp8

- new landscape of threats -> post quantum encryption in java
- two new API blocks: KEM - key encapsulation mechanism 
                      KDF - key derivation function

A) Leighton-Micali Signatures (HSS/LMS)
 - java 21: keyfactory only on public keys
            signatures - only verification of signature
            generating pairs only through 3rd party JCE provider
   java 22: jarsigner - signing jars
            keytool to generate HSS/LMS keypairs with 3rd party JCE provider
            
B) Module Lattice based Key Encapsulation Mechanism - ML-KEM   
  - JEP 496, delivered in Java 24
  - based on KEM API from Java 21
  - new KeyPairGenerator, KeyFactory and KEM implementations - back-ported to Java17
  - 3 parameter sets: ML-KEM-512, 768, 1024 bits
  - for sharing secret securely (if Diffie-Hellman not secure), not signature algorithm
  - supported in keytool for ML-KEM pairs and certificates (for certs needs to be signed with different alg, such as ML-DSA, RSA)
  
C) Module Lattice based Digital Signature Algorithm - ML-DSA   
  - JEP 497, delivered in Java 24 
  - new KeyPairGenerator, KeyFactory and Signature implementations 
  - 3 parameter sets: ML-DSA-44, 65, 87 
  - supported in keytool for ML-DSA key pairs and certificates
  
- some threats not threats anymore 
  - applets - deprecated in Java 9, 
            - plugin removed in Java 11
  - deprecated security manager - solution for problems that 'does not exist anymore'
                                - pain in the ass to maintain (for sandboxing) -> containers & hypervisors came to ensure sandboxing
                                - since Java 1.0, rarely used on server side, primary for client
                                - deprecated in Java 17 - prints warning at startup (can enforce fail with -D jvm param -Djava.security.manager=disallow)
                                - disabled in Java 24 - exception/error at startup
                                                      - API still present but nonfunctional - planned to be removed
                                                                                            - benefit - libs that use it can still work (if well handled nulls)
  - JAAS - Java Authentication and Authorization Service
         - service to authenticate and later allow authorization
         - replacement API added in Java 18

Recent enhancements:         
- Java 22 adds -XshowSettings:security option
                 - shows properties, providers and TLS sub-options   
- Java 23 adds new keystore for macOS root certificates KeychainStore-Root
                 - sets javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType property to use the keystore for TLS connections
                 - meaning 2 keystores - one for keystore key-pairs
                                                 keystore-root for certificates
- Java 24 adds Key Derivation Function API
                 - JEP 478, preview, new API for deriving keys from key material and other data
                 - should be handful for PQC (post quantum cryptography)
