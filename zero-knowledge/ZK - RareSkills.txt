P, NP
- if P = NP -> if I can verify something fast, can I also find fast solution to be verified - most probably not, thus P != NP
- alg runs: 'fast' in polynomial time O(n^c) - time is not extended significantly based on size of input
            'slow' in exponential time O(c^n) - becomes exponentially slow if input size increases 
             c > 1 
             
- P - problem can be verified and calculated in 'fast' polynomial time - e.g. sorting - quicksort O(n log n), nlogn < n * n, verify in O(n)
                                                                              find index of element with certain value in array O(n), verify even in O(1)
                                                                              
- witness - proof that calculation was done correctly
          - solution that can be verified
          
- PSPACE - problems that need: exponential resources to solve, but poly to verify
                               but not necessarily need exponential memory 
         - no efficient algorithm found yet - if so, current encryption in danger                       
         -> not all problems can be efficiently verified - ideal chess move   
                                                         - compare if two regexes provides the same result
         - harder problems than PSPACE - checkers - if not limited space, we need to check were we can place check, or possibly grow in space for the 'board'     
 
 - NP - "non-deterministic polynomial" - problems that can be quickly verified, but not computed
      - computation might need exponential resources
      - thus all P are subset of NP, but unlikely that NP = P (all NP problems can have solution in poly resources)
      - e.g. sudoku filling, 3-coloring map 
 
- all P and NP problems might be verified by transforming into boolean formulas and verifying the solution of the formulas
