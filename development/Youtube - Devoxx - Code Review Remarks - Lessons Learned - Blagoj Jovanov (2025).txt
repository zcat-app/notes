Code Review Remarks: Lessons Learned
video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SdrnPtzBh4

- have business context about the PR
   - clear description of tasks (hahahaha, welcome to the real world)            
   - focus on business logic  
      - he suggests to go from biggest abstraction down until model layer
      - not sure if he means to verify business logic
   
- code style   
   - code reusability - DRY principle
      - don't overdo it, too many abstractions sucks (yes, it does)
   
   - readability
      - "cognitive load" like talk
      - bad practices:
          - overuse ternary operator - multiple lines branching
          - stream that are immediately collected
          - naming (as always) 
             - short or descriptive?-> find balance! (*golf clap*)
               
      
   - simplification of complex tasks
      - kinda shitting on juniors here
  
- optimization
   - after the resolving code style xD
   - using cache instead of going to DB again
   - using proper data structure - list x map
   
- write meaningful tests   
   - cover the business logic
   - verify we did not break anything (whoa!)
   - mocks are shit??
   
- javadocs
   - over-usage on self-documenting code
   - document only important logic 

- suspicious code - not sure what and why - ask question to implementer

- avoid long discussions in PR
   - do not make it like threads, discuss offline and write summary
    
- consult before implementation (not really CR side)
   - "ask the big boss if he likes your solution" 

- avoid adding too many reviewers
   - waiting for other reviews - latency
   - 1-2 are ideal - one familiar with business logic
                   - one to clean up mess if first is bottleneck

- delegate you can not handle all CR

- share responsibility - no finger point on failure

- there is no perfect code, we try to achieve to get close

own remarks:
I would add you are not your code, do not take it personal
A bit disappointing, but I misunderstood the goal probably
