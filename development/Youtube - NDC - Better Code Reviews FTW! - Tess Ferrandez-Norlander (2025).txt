code with engineering
- https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook

- if we do not argue we do not invest in finding defects 
   - might not be truth, computers might do better job in that than human

code reviews should 
- find defects
- share patterns
- share knowledge
- increase a sense of ownership - not my code, but our code
- find better solution

~ tl;dr provide feedback = communication
- communication in PR:
   - usually short text
   - mostly negative (we don't often mention good steps)
   - Michael Lynch - How to do core reviews like a human - blog
                   - A developer's Guide to Happy Romance - book
                   
Points:
1) (Implementor) Be open for feedback
- ask for targeted feedback 
  - "is this the best approach, I would love some feedback"
  - people can be more focused/creative for more narrow scope
  - "isnt better to use X?": dont - "Fixed"
                             do - "Nice, did not know X" ~ keep conversation
    "what does this do?": dont - "It does bla bla bla"
                          do -"Let me change to understand better"
- award all ties to reviewer - reviewer 'always' wins 
   - reviewer comes with fresh context, like everyone else who did not implement
   
2) (Implementor) Write PRs you would like to review   
- make your code readable/understandable
- keep PRs small - narrower scope
- describe PR
   - what does it solve
   - what is not covered
   - how is it tested
   - highlight special features/parts
- review your PR first!

3) (Team) Settle style arguments with style guides
- consistent, clear and easy to implement
- "avoids please do this" - "but I like this more"

4) (Team) Automate the boring bits
- typos, styling (header level), null check
- checkstyle, check for secrets, run tests  
-> then developer can focus on solving task and if solved in the best way

5) (Reviewer) Start reviewing immediately
- waiting is bad - can lead to branching issues
- treat PR with the highest priority (old task usually higher priority than old tasks, until something critical pops up)
   -> finish PR before starting something new
      notify people about new PR
      
6) (Reviewer) Don't overhelm the author 
- developer patience is finite
- create hierarchy of problems and solve the biggest/highest  first 
- dont repeat on the same issue - 'trust' colleague
                                -> "check/apply other places too"
- respect the scope - dont extend over topic 
   - dont do: "when you edit this, can you do even that?" 
   - do: make a new PR, maybe by yourself? (hmmmm)
   

7) (Reviewer) We dont always have to go for perfect
- level of code quality: obviously wrong - does not solve the problem
                         seems to work - hard to understand /refactor
                         works - could be more readable, could have more tests
                         pretty good - smaller naming
                         perfect
- from 'works' level can be merged if necessary, hard to achieve perfect, can help with pair programming with newbies from 'works' to get at least to 'pretty good' - investment for next time, maybe next time we go from 'pretty good' to 'perfect'
- approve if remaining tasks are trivial
- tell people if you like what they did - reinforce good habits
                                        - positive feedback - easier to change ourselves for good words than bad words
                                        
8) (Reviewer) Be generous with examples 
- simpler to understand, sometimes just comment might not be clear, reviewed person might not know the buzzword, etc

9) (Reviewer) Frame feedback as question
- avoid ordering to people, transfer it to conversation

10) (Reviewer)  Dont make it personal, dont take it personally
- using 'we' instead of 'you', 'you' is 'pointing' and 'accusatory'
- focus on code, not the author
- comment principles, not opinions -> add why something should be changed
- avoid 'buddy reviews' like 'i trust you bro, approved'

11) (Reviewer) Resolve stalemates proactively
- argument when reviewer wants change, implementor not
   - raising number of comments
   - most comments rejected
   - hostile tone
   
   => call and discuss, try to resolve
      bring another person for another opinion
      give up - also solution, letting life progress
              - add a new task to 'fix' implementation later
              - do design review with larger group
              
- Q/A - if pushed for bigger change by reviewer - try to discuss if new PR might be better solution
      - commit level reviews - gerrit must approve every commit? <`(((-< fishy :)
      - git hooks - good to use
      - PR comments as learning
