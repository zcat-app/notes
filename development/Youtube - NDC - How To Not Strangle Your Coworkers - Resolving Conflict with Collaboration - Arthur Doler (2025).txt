- conflict vs disagreement

- disagreement - 2 or more people differing/opposing opinions/belief about something at work
- conflict: if disagreement is important
            if we are interdependent ~ if we win/fail together 
            if both believe evidences are on their side

-usual cope: pretending it does not exist - does not help

- conflict types:
a) Task Conflict
- about what we are doing, tools we use, approaches, tickets, team goals
- different opinions and point of views * can help find overlooked problem
- good 

b) Process Conflict
- conflict about process - how we do the work, who is in charge, who and why does decisions, how do we achieve goals
- helps explores new ways of working, helps find if the right people are in the team
- good at beginning, later becomes toxic - unfairness, not enough resources
- can be between teams (who is responsible for module) and individuals

c) Relationship Conflict
- about power moves, about with we work
- the worst

- effort to maximize good conflicts, lower bad conflicts

Psychological safety
- people feel safe enough to speak up to what they actually believe
- note: showed social graph with relations to keep relations to survive
          - dev - QA, dev - manager, dev - family          
- not only being nice - toxic positivity == toxic negativity
- context changes - in my team, in different team
- can prevent catastrophic events, holding back is bad
- brings higher performance & engagement + allows to find hidden conflicts
- has to be built in team, only can be achieved if environment is prepared
    - book The fearless organization 
      -1) Set the stage
          - frame the work
          - emphasize purpose
       2) Invite Participation
           - demonstrate situational humility!
               - no one know everything
               - say I DONT KNOW instead of uneducated opinion
               - not everything others say is wrong
                   - the world is not how we perceive it, every one does see differently, different values
           - practice inquiry! (~ exploring, learning)
               - asking question is not weak
               - ask: about you do not know the answer
                      dont limit to YES/NO questions 
                      in way it helps others share thinking in focused manner
                      elaboration questions - understand why
       3) Respond productively
           - express appreciation!
               - good feedback on question/response
           - destigmatize failure
           - sanction violations
           
Emotions
- controlling emotions, not suppressing them
- book Theory in Practice - Increasing Professional Effectiveness
       - conflict types: Model 1 - win in zero-sum game
                                 - aim to control (minimize) emotions of other participants
                                 - using concrete strategies to get the outcome
                                 - creates: a) self-fulfilling prophecies 
                                              - loop of self-confirming events
                                              - push one person - that person starts pushing you
                                            b) self-sealing processes
                                              - not being honest (e.g. about performance) and trying to push in different direction (position) - solve quietly, while the the manipulated person gets angry about deception and resist - no way out without direct confrontation
                                 
                         Model 2 - tries to achieve win-win 
                                 - accept emotions of participants
                                 - avoid self-sealing processes
                                 
- people afraid of conflict leans to Model 1
    - moral language (you are bad person), anger incorrect opinions
    -> prepare Psychological safety for uncomfortable situations
        - talk about emotions
           - retrospective
           - post mortem incidents

- even 'good' conflict can transform to bad conflict - e.g. fight of two senior devs moved to personal conflict
- try to keep conflict localized, e.g. focused on the task
   - conversational receptiveness
     - H.E.A.R
        Hedging - soften your opinion - maybe, perhaps, sometimes
        Emphasizing agreement - highlight what you agree on/like
        Acknowledgement - active listening - don't think what you say next but process the input
                                           - rephrase what was said to confirm you understand it
        Reframing to Positive  - "i hate when people interrupt me" x "i love when people let me finish my thoughts"    
        
Confrontation styles
- Yielding
   - passive + pro social - you care about others, solving by giving others' demands
- Avoiding
   - passive, hope it will get solved by itself, rather than discuss change the topic
- Cooperating
   - active + pro-self & pro-social, identify issues and solutions for both, tires to achieve feel of personal outcome to both sides
- Fighting
   - active + pro-self, tactics to intimidate, mandates, challenges, insults, accusing 
- Conciliating
   - mixed approach, win over others by let them win some... :thinking:
   
- single contributor should engage, even not manager or having power, might help to reshape
   - be aware of power dynamics
   - pick you conflicts carefully
   
- position vs goal
   - goal - what we want to achieve
   - position - how we want to achieve 
              - we cannot shift other goals, but rather positions (to met even our goals)
